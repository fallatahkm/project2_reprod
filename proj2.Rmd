

Loading and preprocessing the Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
directory <- ("./activity.csv/")
activity <- read_csv("activity.csv", na = c( "","NA"))
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, tryFormats= "%Y-%m-%d")
activity$weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)
summary(activity)
head(activity)
echo = TRUE
```
1. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist(tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, sum),main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total steps taken per day", col = "red", ylim = c(0,20), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500))

echo = TRUE
```

the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day, 

```{r}
mean(tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, sum),na.rm = T)
median(tapply(activity$steps,activity$date, sum),na.rm = T)
echo = TRUE
```


2. What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
av_da_activity <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean, na.rm = T)

plot(av_da_activity$interval, av_da_activity$steps, type = "l", col="red", lwd = 2, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")

echo = TRUE
```
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}

av_da_activity[max(av_da_activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE),][[1]]

echo = TRUE
```

3. Imputing missing values
we calculate and report the total number and and the percentage of missing values 

```{r}
number_NA <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
percent_NA<- mean(is.na(activity$steps))
print(number_NA)
print(percent_NA)
echo = TRUE
```

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
activity$mean_impute <- if_else(is.na(activity$steps) , 
        mean(activity$steps,na.rm = T),activity$steps)
head(activity)
echo = TRUE
```

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
mean(tapply(activity$mean_impute,activity$date, sum))
median(tapply(activity$mean_impute,activity$date, sum))
echo = TRUE
```
4. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r}
hist(tapply(activity$mean_impute,activity$date, sum), col = "red", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))

echo = TRUE
```
4.1 Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:

5. Are there any differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

7.Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
activity$week <-as.factor(ifelse(activity$weekday == "Saturday"| 
                activity$weekday == "Sunday", "Weekend","Weekday"))
stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + week, activity, mean)
head(stepsByDay)

echo = TRUE
```
7.1 Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)
```{r}
ggplot(stepsByDay, aes(x = interval, y = steps, color= week)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(week ~ .) +
    xlab("Interval") + 
    ylab("Mean of steps") +
    ggtitle("Comparison of Average Number of Steps in Each Interval")

echo = TRUE
```
